# npm resolution error report

While resolving: hangar@1.0.0
Found: react-native-svg@15.11.2
node_modules/react-native-svg
  react-native-svg@"15.11.2" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react-native-svg@"^6.2.1||^7.0.3" from react-native-svg-charts@5.4.0
node_modules/react-native-svg-charts
  react-native-svg-charts@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
